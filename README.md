# PlayerMeowing
a cute minecraft plugin that allows players to meow! :3

## Usage
currently, chat messages are matched with a regex, which i'm not the best at making, so feel free to make a PR to improve the patterns.

you can send any of the following keywords to make it's corresponding sound:
- **"meow"** will play `Sound.ENTITY_CAT_AMBIENT`
- **"mreow"** or **"mrrp"** will play `Sound.ENTITY_CAT_PURREOW`
- **"purr"** will play `Sound.ENTITY_CAT_PURR`

note that this is case-insensitive and allows for repeated characters, so messages like **"MEEEOWWW"** will also work!
